```python
# Pseudo-code structure
async def batch_process_documents(uploaded_files):
    results = []
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_single_doc, file) for file in uploaded_files]
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            results.append(future.result())
    return results
